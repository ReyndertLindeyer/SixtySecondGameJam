# Sixty Second Game Jam
The game itself is a simple 'avoid the enemies' game where you are a white circle and the enemies will point towards you and then launch themselves after you with some enemies launching projectiles while doing so. When playing you have three lives and simply have to survive for sixty seconds.

There should be no set up necessary, simply run the .exe and then select the level you want to play.
